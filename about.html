                    <b>Hi, I'm Dominic Yamarone. </b> I'm from Los Angeles, CA and graduated from Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I majored in mechanical
                    engineering with a minor in electrical engineering. My main interests are robotics
                    and aerospace, especially in places where the two intersect. I also have a passion for music and worked as a DJ and writer
		    for WRBB, the campus radio station. Here I got the chance to <a href="http://wrbbradio.org/author/dominic-yamarone/">write album reviews and conduct interviews with some really talented musicians.</a> 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I did four  internships during my college career. My first was at NASA JPL in La Ca&#241;ada, CA. There I
                    worked on cable harness engineering for the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ecostress">ECOSTRESS</a> mission.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I also worked at
                    Hasbro as part of the Integrated Play team. We focused on developing new forms of play with emerging technologies like VR, voice recognition,
                    and computer vision. A few of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/amazons-echo-buttons-get-their-own-version-of-trivial-pursuit/">games</a> I helped develop for Amazon Alexa became released by Amazon as their first games to work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfVTTG5cedQ">Echo Buttons</a>.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    My second co op was at <a href="https://www.flir.com/uis/ugs"> Endeavor Robotics</a>, now known as FLIR Unmanned Ground Systems, a military robotics company that developed UGV systems for EOD and Search and Rescue. As
                    a Systems Engineering, Instrumentation, and Test intern I developed and executed tests to verify that the systems met customer requirements.
                    I also helped work on proposals that Endeavor has since been successfully awarded.
                </p>
                
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    My third and final co op was at MORSE Corp in Cambridge, MA. MORSE is a fairly young defense startup that specializes in
                    mission planning and airdrop. I worked on developing flight systems for the DARPA ICARUS program and other similar programs.
                    My work allowed the team to test new designs more reliably and safely. I also helped build these flight systems and prepare them for test.
                </p>
                
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I recently finished my degree at Northeastern and graduated in December 2019. For my capstone design project I worked with a team to develop a robotic arm and haptic exoskeleton for the Avatar X-PRIZE challenge. I recently started full time
		    at a robotics startup in Los Angeles. I'm working here as a Mechanical Engineer with responsibilities that range from early R&D to manufacturing of our systems. 
                    I feel that what I've learned in personal projects, co ops, and of course classes has helped prepare me to be confident in any career. As I continue to work on projects you can find summaries here.
                    Thanks for checking out my website!
