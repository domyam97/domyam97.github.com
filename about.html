                    <b>Hi, I'm Dominic Yamarone. </b> I grew up in Los Angeles, CA and am going to school in Boston, MA at Northeastern University. I'm majoring in mechanical
                    engineering with a minor in electrical engineering. My two main interests are robotics
                    and aerospace, especially in places where the two intersect. I also have a passion for music and work as a DJ and staff writer
                    for WRBB, the campus radio station. Here I get the chance to write album reviews and conduct interviews with bands. 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I've done three internships during my college career. My first was at NASA JPL in La Ca&#241;ada, CA. There I
                    worked on cable harness engineering for the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ecostress">ECOSTRESS</a> mission.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I also worked at
                    Hasbro as part of the Integrated Play team. We focused on developing new forms of play with emerging technologies like VR, voice recognition,
                    and computer vision. A few of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/amazons-echo-buttons-get-their-own-version-of-trivial-pursuit/">games</a> I helped develop for Amazon Alexa became released by Amazon as their first games to work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfVTTG5cedQ">Echo Buttons</a>.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    My most recent co op was at <a href="http://endeavorrobotics.com/"> Endeavor Robotics</a>, a military robotics company that developed robotic systems for EOD and Search and Rescue. As
                    a Systems Engineering, Instrumentation, and Test intern I developed and executed tests to verify that the systems met customer requirements.
                    I also helped work on proposals that Endeavor has since been successfully awarded.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.2em;">
                    I'm currently working on finishing up my degree here at Northeastern. I plan to graduate in December 2019 after my third and 
                    final co op. After school, I'd like to move into the Massachusetts robotics industry or back to Los Angeles to work in aerospace. 
                    I feel that what I've learned in personal projects, co ops, and of course classes has helped prepare me to be confident in any career.
                    Thanks for checking out my website!
