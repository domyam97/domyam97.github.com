                As Project Lead, I was in charge of overall system architecture, power plant design, controls, 
                and aerodynamics for the OS-3 Raven. With a team of about 10 students, we 
                designed this plane for the SAE Aero Micro class in 2018, but weren't able to compete. The challenge
                for this competition was to carry as much PVC tube "payload" as possible while remaining compact and easily
                assembled. We continued to develop the plane and refine the design 
                for the 2019 Competition. We attended the 2019 SAE Aero Design East competition in May 2019.

                    <p> During the design stage, we worked to identify the best strategy for the competition.

                    stability and therefore versatility in payload. </p>
